I cannot generate a binary .ico file directly as text content. However, I can provide you with a few alternatives:

1. **Use an online favicon generator** like favicon.io or realfavicongenerator.net to create a proper .ico file
2. **Use a simple PNG instead** - most modern browsers support PNG favicons
3. **Use an SVG favicon** for scalability

Here's what you should do:
- Create a simple 16x16 or 32x32 pixel icon with "H" or "Hello" text
- Convert it to .ico format using an online tool
- Save it as assets/favicon.ico

For immediate testing, you could temporarily rename a small PNG file to favicon.ico, though a proper .ico file is recommended for production.
